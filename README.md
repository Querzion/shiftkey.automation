Shift Key Automation Tool; for scraping, saving & redeeming Gearbox Shift key codes.

Borderlands 1-3, The Pre-Sequal & Tiny Tinas Wonderlands on the Steam, Epic, Xboxlive & PSN platforms. It's still in very early development, and might soon be of use, if it works as planned.

This tool is created in tandem with the usage of ChatGPT, since I have limited C# skills. The tool is supposed to scrape codes from various places, or maybe just the one site that is most up to date with their shift key collection, and save them into individual files. The codes are checked for for the expiration date and those that are still active, are used for the redeeming service.

I want to create this tool as a service to the community, since the other AutoShift tools that I have found do not seem to work at the moment.

The Idea is simple, but the application might end up a problem, since I have never created anything outside of school projects and never really used docker.

Let's see what comes out of this thought process though.
